- Install now by run **npm install -g now**
- Go to the project root using CMD or a terminal in VSCode
- Start the deployment by running **now**, the first time you mast need to enter your email and verify it
- When the deployment be ready, an URL will be shown, navigate to it using your favorite browser, look for the last deployment and copy the URL
- Paste the URL deployment to the browser
- And  Vuala!! that is all

## Developed with üõ†Ô∏è

_The project was developed with ReactJS by using [facebook‚Äôs create react app library](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to create the base project structure_

* NPM as the package manager, if you do not have installed npm, you must install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [react-confetti 6.0.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti): To show the confetti animation when a product is redeemed successfully. We used this package due to there is not vulnerabilities detected, you can see more information in [Snyk](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:react-confetti)
* [react-router-dom 5.2.0](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start): To set routes in your application and navigate between pages based on the components
* [styled-components 5.3.0](https://www.styled-components.com/): Styled-components to stylize the components by using CSS code. The style is being associated only with the component to which it belongs, without affecting the rest of the elements on the page
* [@material-ui/core 4.11.4](@material-ui/core): To create the beauty modal to inform the user when the product was redeemed successfully
* [@fortawesome/react-fontawesome 0.1.14](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react): To create the menu in the navbar


## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

_I must recognize that this application was made base on the Agostina Arevalo Jaube [project code](https://github.com/AgostinaArevaloJaube/aerolab-challenge) who made an awesome job with the application style when she tackled the Aerlolab challenge. I used it as a guide to give the style to my app, then I improved the application behavior to make easy the navigation between pages and improve the user experience._

For that reason, I will add Agustina as part of the authors of this application
